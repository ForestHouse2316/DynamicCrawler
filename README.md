# DynamicCrawler
A dynamic crawler for android devices.
  
  
#### Start of Dynamic Crawler
There is a number of chatting bots for 'Whats App', 'Facebook Messenger', 'KakaoTalk', and so on.  
Most of them are based on Rhino_JS engine, people have been able to use it as a crawler.  
But of course it is just a static crawling.  
So I thought 'Why there is nothing about "Dynamic"? I think it can also be used in school.'  
It is a start of dynamic crawler.
